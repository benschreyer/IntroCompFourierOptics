function result = gain_sheet_saturable(coordinates, field, sat, alpha, power, size)
    % Implementation of lightpipes, see lightpipes laser_simulation
    % An amplitude gain that reduces by a square root at the saturation intensity sat
    % Assumes the gain can be modeled as a diffraction in vacuum and then a gain effect at the furthest plane
    % Note the conversion of a normalized amplitude and power, into intensity samples by dividing by the area of grid cells,
    % and multiplying by the power
